# 3296-Minesweeper
This is my take on the Minesweeper game developed in Java for 3296 Software Design class at Temple University. The game will use the practices of TDD and Object-Oriented programming in order to create an easy to use GUI that the user will use to interact with the game.
Below is a rough UML diagram that shows a basic plan on how the program will be created.
